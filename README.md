I'm too lazy to develop anything, so during work hours <br>
I write this readme on github, thinking I'm the coolest developer on earth. <br> 
At the same time I'm thinking about how nice it would be to take this cute girl <br>
out for a walk or something. <br/>
(i did it.)

If you still think I'm a good developer, <br>
you've probably met a very arrogant me on one of the discord servers, <br>
furiously trying to prove a completely unviable theory or some other unnecessary bullshit.

Dude, do you really think I'm going to brag about my code?
